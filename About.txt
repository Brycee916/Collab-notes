Perfect — that’s a very realistic goal. Let’s scope it to a medium-sized project that gives you a fully working collaborative note editor with real-time sync and accounts, but without overengineering (no CRDT internals, no complex infra).

We’ll keep it achievable within ~3–4 weeks of part-time work.

🔹 Project goal (simplified version)

Build a collaborative note app where:

Two or more users can edit the same note in real time.

Each user has an account (signup/login).

Notes are stored in a database and can be reloaded later.

Uses WebSockets for real-time updates.

🔹 Tech stack (balanced between simplicity and capability)
Part	Choice	Why
Frontend	React (Vite)	Fast dev setup, easy state management.
Editor	Quill.js	Simple rich text editor with minimal setup.
Backend	Node.js + Express + Socket.IO	Socket.IO simplifies real-time messaging.
Database	MongoDB (via Mongoose)	Easy to store note contents as JSON/text.
Auth	JWT (JSON Web Token)	Simple login/session without Firebase complexity.

You can later swap Socket.IO for Yjs if you want full CRDT merging — but for now, Socket.IO keeps it lightweight and understandable.

🔹 What you’ll actually build

✅ Phase 1 — Core Collaboration (Week 1–1.5)

A React + Quill editor that updates in real time between connected users.

Backend WebSocket server that syncs document content between users.

Basic REST API to load/save notes.

✅ Phase 2 — User Accounts (Week 2)

Add signup/login using JWT.

Only logged-in users can access notes.

Associate notes with users in MongoDB.

✅ Phase 3 — Document Management (Week 3)

A dashboard showing a list of notes per user.

Create/edit/delete notes.

Share note link (basic URL share).

✅ (Optional) Phase 4 — Polish (Week 4)

Save notes automatically every few seconds.

Add collaborator cursors or colored names.

Deploy to Render or Railway (backend) + Netlify or Vercel (frontend).

🔹 Architecture diagram (conceptually)
React (frontend)
   │
   ├── REST: /login, /signup, /notes
   │
   └── WebSocket: /sync/:noteId  ← handles real-time typing
          │
     Node.js + Socket.IO server
          │
     MongoDB (stores users and notes)

🔹 Example flow

User logs in → gets JWT token.

User opens a note (/note/:id) → frontend connects to backend via WebSocket.

Each keystroke or text change emits an event ("text-update") to the server.

Server broadcasts that change to all other connected users editing the same note.

Notes are periodically saved to MongoDB.
